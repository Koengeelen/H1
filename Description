This proyect is based on the controll, monitoring and processing of data extracted from a small 2 stroke engine.
The proyect is divided in three parts, the first one is the arduino code that controlls a small interactive module to act on the engine and gather all of the data.
The next part is the raspberry code, which gathers all of the information to be saved and displayed live in another small module that integrates a small display.
Finally there is the 3D models of every part in the engine to make designs to add sensors or improve the engine.

  Arduino:
    
  
  Raspberry:
  
  3D Model:
    The 3D model includes a general assembly of all of the parts along with evary part organised by groups. 
    It also includes the 3D models for both the arduino and the raspberry modules.
